## Key Features
* User Authentication: Implement user registration and login using JWT for authentication.
* Real-Time Collaboration: Use WebSockets to allow multiple users to edit a document in real-time.
* Document Management: CRUD operations for documents.
* Event Loop and Async Programming: Handle I/O operations efficiently and use async/await for managing asynchronous tasks.
* Error Handling: Robust error handling and logging.
* Database Integration: Use MongoDB for storing user and document data.
* Security: Implement basic security practices such as input validation, sanitization, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

## Key Requirements
* File Organization
* online editing 
* Collaboration (real-time)
* Sharing and permissions

## Sync Strategies 
* Event Parsing -> (OT)
  - Operations ->   
    INSERT(char, position) like (A, 1)
    DELETE(char, position)
    UPDATE(char,  new char, position)
    RETAIN(char, position)
    is the basic operation. But there can be numerous operations in Google Docs. Change font, color, font family, font size, etc...

* Differentail synchronisation

## Hight Level Design 
* Storage and Formatting
* Concurrency -> collaborative editing: (CRDTs) and (OT) algorithms
* Access Control -> (RBAC)
* authentication and authorization
* CRUD 
* Monitoring and Observability -> metrics, logs, and trace data 

## Challenges 
* allowing multiple users to edit the same document without conflicting changes -> (OT)
* ensuring that simultaneous edits are effectively merged without causing issues -> Collaborative protocol


## Design Constraint
* Concurrency: A lot of people are working on the same document
* Latency: People are working in different places and they connect throughout the internet, so there is a latency between each and every know clients or users when they are sharing the same document.

* Google Docs users get a lot of storage space with their accounts, but it's not unlimited. Each account can have up to:
    - 5,000 documents of up to 500 kilobytes each
    - 1,000 spreadsheets of up to 1 megabyte each
    - 5,000 presentations of up to 10 megabytes each
